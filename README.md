# Next.js CRUD Application with MongoDB and Tailwind CSS

This is a sample Next.js application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on posts and store the data in MongoDB using Mongoose. The application also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB



## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-mongodb-crud.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd nextjs-mongodb-crud
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
   ```

   > Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with the URI of your MongoDB database.
   > Replace `your-google-client-id` with the client id of your google account.
   > Replace `your-google-client-secret` with the client id of your google account.
   > Replace `your-nextauth-secret` using the secret generated by 
   ```
    openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

### How to get GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID & GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
1. Goto https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create new project
3. Goto APIs & Service
4. Click OAuth consent screen
* Input "nextprompt" App name
* Input your email in User support email
* Input your email in Developer contact information 
5. Click Credentials > OAuth client ID
* Select "Web Application" in Application Type
* Leave Name as "Web client 1"
* In Authorized JavaScript origns, add URI as http://localhost:3000
* In Authorized redirect URI, 
    add URI as http://localhost:3000
    add URI as http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
* Copy the Client ID and Client Secret


### How to get MONGODB_URI
1. Go to mongodb, register / login, 
2. create cluster. 
3. In Database Access, create a user account and password
4. In Network Access, add the IP Address 
5. In Database, click database, click Connect, click Driver, Get Connection string.


## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Features

- **Create**: Users can create new posts by filling out a form.
- **Read**: Users can view a list of all posts and click on individual posts to see the details.
- **Update**: Users can edit the content of existing posts.
- **Delete**: Users can delete posts from the application.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing the posts data.
- Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
